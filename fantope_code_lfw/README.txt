This is a Beta version for the code of our CVPR 2014 paper : Fantope Regularization in Metric Learning.

The MATLAB script demo_lfw.m gives an instance of how this code is meant to be used on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset.
For simplicity, the user can also run the command "split_demo_lfw(i)" where i is the index of the i-th (predefined) split of LFW. It returns the accuracy of the model for the i-th split. Since there are 10 predefined splits, i is an integer that takes value between 1 and 10.
